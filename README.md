a code to change a ci2cv landmark created with the option --3d --video to a corresponding BVH file.

it's written with the intention of converting a ci2cv landmark directory creator say with the following command:

face-fit --3d --video videoLocation landmarkDirectory/someName%.pts

Thus assumes all the files in the direcotry are landmark files for same video source. 

When executing the BVHCreator (contains main); Follow the following steps:
1. Enter the save Location of the BVH file that you want to create. 
2. Enter the Directory of landmarks generated by ci2cv. 
3. Enter the location of the normal pose amongst or from any specific frame in video that we rather choose to be our normal pose. 

Creates the file .bvh at the specified location. 

The template.bvh file is how template for how the whole bvh file would look like; as it pertains to how ci2cv can only generate 2d geometric locations 
and recompute 3d location; we choose 3 degrees of freedom format of the bvh file.
